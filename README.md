# brfssproj
This is the repository for the files submitted for the Choose Your Own project for the HarvardX Data Capstone, 
the final  module of the Professional Certificate in Data Science.  
Due to github file size restrictions the dataset brfss.R is a selection of the data required for the project,
derived from the BRFSS 2015 dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website.

The R script for the project will take around 3 to 4 minutes to run on a computer with 8Gb RAM.
